# SCARA-Robot-Arm

A SCARA type robot arm with four degrees of freedom


### Abstract
At the time of conception, I had no singular end application for this project, I saw it as a way to develop my skills in various parts of engineering design. 

Upon further consideration, the potential applications of use cases of this robot are quite robust. One that comes to mind is PCB development; specifically with regards to component pick and place. Other applications include CNC milling, 3D printing, laser engraving, process automation for manufacturing, and as much as you can imagine.

This project pushes me to learn new concepts and develop my skills in 3D CAD, Electronic circuit (PCB) design and Embedded software development.
I say this because every aspect of this project involves utilizing or developing skills in the areas listed above.
